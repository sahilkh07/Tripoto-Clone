                The monsoons are here in full force and if you thought you had to spend it stationed indoors with a cup
                of coffee, you’re mistaken. Travel doesn’t have to take a backseat this August because the monsoon
                season is one of the best times to explore nature in all its glory! Lush green forests, beautiful
                waterfalls, natural plunge pools, abundant rivers, misty mountains, and quiet beaches - you can have it
                all! <br>

                What’s more, with goSTOPS properties located in some of the most breathtaking monsoon destinations in
                India, you don’t need to burn a hole in your pocket or think twice about packing your bags and heading
                out for your next adventure. Here’s everything you need to know about enjoying the magic of the monsoon
                on a budget!

                    Escape to the sprawling tea gardens of Munnar this monsoon to experience the serene South Indian
                    hill town in all its beauty. Complete with lush green valleys, magnificent waterfalls, and
                    picturesque lakes that will leave you spell-bound, it’s the ideal nature getaway to bask in the
                    morning mist with a cup of freshly-brewed chai. Walk through endless tea plantations, learn how tea
                    is plucked and manufactured, taste different kinds of brews, and enjoy the gorgeous weather of
                    Kerala’s Western Ghats.

                    goSTOPS Munnar is located in Anachal, merely 30 minutes away from the main town of Munnar, which
                    stands at 6000 ft in the Idukki region of Kerala. Away from the crowds and yet, equipped with all
                    amenities, the property stands amidst tropical plantations and close to all the main attractions:
                    the Mattupetty dam, Pothamedu viewpoint, and the Top Station viewpoint - the highest point in
                    Munnar. Learn about the diverse flora and fauna during your morning and evening walks, take a
                    Shikara ride on Kundala Lake, and soak in views of the lush green foliage around you.

                    Airport (140 km away by car). Alternatively, you can take a train to Ernakulam or Madurai; Aluva is
                    the nearest stop to Munnar (110km away). Munnar is also well-connected by bus from several locations
                    in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

                    A true Goa-lover knows that monsoons are a world-apart in the coastal state. Empty, drenched
                    beaches, pristine greens, swelling waterfalls, and off-season pricing – what’s not to love?
                </p>
                <p id="para_a">
                    Explore Goa’s art and culture scene, the heritage buildings in the South, or go find your own
                    private plunge pool. There’s more to Goa than its beaches and this is best explored in the rainy
                    season! Fort Aguada, Dudhsagar Falls, and Chapora Fort are just some of the many options.

                    Say goodbye to the hustle-bustle of city life and enter the world of mountains, meadows, and tea
                    plantations in Ooty. An abode of the clouds in the monsoons and located at an elevation of 2,200 ft,
                    this charming hill station feels like it's straight out of a storybook. Aptly called ‘the Queen of
                    the Hills’, nestled in the blue Nilgiri mountains, the colonial past of the place mixed with its
                    heritage buildings and its enthralling natural landscape, makes it one of South India’s most popular
                    tourist destinations. You can visit Dolphin’s Nose Viewpoint, the Botanical Gardens, and take a ride
                    on the famous Nilgiri toy train from Mettupalayam to Ooty!

                    Mysore/Bengaluru route. It is close to the Gymkhana Golf Club and has two blocks - the heritage
                    block which is a 100-year-old colonial bungalow with high roofs, wooden flooring, four poster beds,
                    and vintage furniture - and the new block, with ample outdoor seating and modern amenities.

                    also several luxury buses that can take you directly to Ooty from Bangalore, Mysore, and Chennai.
